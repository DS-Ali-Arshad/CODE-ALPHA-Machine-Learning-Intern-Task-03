## Introduction
The Music Recommendation System is designed to suggest songs similar to a given song based on the content of their lyrics. It utilizes natural language processing and machine learning to analyze and recommend songs.

## Features
- Data Collection: Collecting song data with lyrics, song names, and artist names.
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, sampling, and preparing the dataset for modeling.
- Text Cleaning: Removing special characters, converting to lowercase, and more.
- Text Tokenization and Stemming: Breaking text into words and stemming for better analysis.
- TF-IDF Vectorization: Converting text data into numerical vectors.
- Cosine Similarity: Calculating the similarity between songs using TF-IDF vectors.
- Recommendation Function: Providing recommendations based on a target song.
- Usage/Demo: Demonstrating the system with random song selections.

## Data Collection
The project starts with data collection from a CSV file that contains information about songs, including lyrics, song names, and artist names. The file is available in the `Dataset` folder. 

## Data Preprocessing
- Unnecessary columns are removed, and duplicates are counted and removed.
- Due to resource limitations, the system works with a subset of 20,000 randomly selected samples.
- Basic statistics and missing value analysis are performed.

## Data Cleaning
Text data is cleaned by removing extra whitespace, converting to lowercase, and removing punctuation and special characters.

## Text Tokenization and Stemming
The lyrics are tokenized into words, and stemming is applied using the Porter Stemmer to reduce words to their root forms.

## TF-IDF Vectorization and Cosine Similarity
Text data is converted into TF-IDF vectors, and cosine similarity is used to measure the similarity between songs.

## Recommendation Function
The `recommend_similar_songs` function recommends similar songs to a given target song based on the cosine similarity scores.

## Usage/Demo
You can use the system by providing a target song, and it will generate a list of recommended songs.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
    ```bash
    https://github.com/DS-Ali-Arshad/CODE-ALPHA-Machine-Learning-Intern-Task-03.git
    ```
2. Install the required libraries and dependencies.
3. Run the provided Jupyter Notebook to explore and use the Music Recommendation System.

## How to Use
1. Import the necessary libraries and mount your Google Drive.
2. Load the dataset, preprocess it, and perform data cleaning.
3. Tokenize and stem the lyrics, vectorize the text, and calculate cosine similarity.
4. Use the `recommend_similar_songs` function to get song recommendations.
